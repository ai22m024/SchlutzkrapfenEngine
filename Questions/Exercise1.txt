Github is a service, where you can host you git projects, make CI/CD Pipelines for them, or share them as public repo.

Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
- It is possible to have controll over the history of code, old scripts that where used a few months ago, can be revisited.
- No accidental delete or overwrite of files.
- Multiple people can work on the same file, and merge it together

Name 3 alternatives to git:
- SVN
- PLastic
- Bitbucket

Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:

Git is Distributed version Controll (On git clone, you get all the historic commits)
SVN is Centralized version controll (There is one central system that stores all)

IN SVN you can checkout a branch at a certain height of the tree, in git you need to clone the whole repo.
